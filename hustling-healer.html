    <h1>Your Archetype: The Aligned Closer</h1>
    <p class="subheading">You’re clear, committed, and ready for aligned mastery.</p>

    <p>You’ve done the healing. You’ve found your voice. You know you’re here to lead—and you’re not afraid of visibility anymore. Now, you’re craving sales that feel as good as your service. Powerful. Simple. Sacred.</p>

    <p>You're already magnetic. You don't need more tricks. You need the structure that supports your next level of ease, income, and impact.</p>

    <p><strong>Aligned selling isn’t about saying the perfect thing. It’s about being the clearest mirror of your own work.</strong> When that’s dialed in, clients feel it. They lean in. They say yes—without resistance.</p>

    <p>This is your season to embody it fully: intuitive sales, clean boundaries, and sustainable success.</p>

    <p><strong>From Monique:</strong>  
    You’re not here to start over—you’re here to refine. I created this system for women like you who are ready to close with confidence, without sacrificing soul. Let’s take what’s already working and elevate it to sacred mastery.</p>
