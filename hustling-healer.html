    <h1>Your Archetype: The Hustling Healer</h1>
    <p class="subheading">You’ve mastered the work—but it’s costing you your peace.</p>

    <p>You’ve taken the courses. Done the healing. Built a business. Maybe you’re already making money—but every dollar feels like effort. You're often the most reliable one in the room… and the most depleted.</p>

    <p>You’re not just tired. You’re worn. And underneath the hustle is a heart that craves space, softness, and simplicity.</p>

    <p><strong>You don’t need to earn your rest.</strong> You don’t need to push through pain to prove your power. You need a system that holds your income goals *and* your energy—without sacrificing either.</p>

    <p>This is your call to soften into structure. To let aligned sales support you, so you can do the work you're called to do—from a full, not fractured, place.</p>

    <p><strong>From Monique:</strong>  
    You’ve done so much. It’s time for you to receive more by doing less. I help women like you release the “grind” and still grow, by anchoring into systems that are sacred, simple, and sustainable.</p>
