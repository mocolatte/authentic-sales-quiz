    <h1>🌸 You Are The Overgiver</h1>
    <p><strong>“You give so much… but forget to receive.”</strong></p>

    <p>You lead with love, care, and generosity—and your heart is in the right place. But somewhere along the way, you started equating your <em>worth</em> with how much you do for others.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Over-delivers in coaching or services</li>
      <li>Feels guilty charging for transformation</li>
      <li>Downplays your brilliance</li>
      <li>Often tired, unseen, or underpaid</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💔 Your Hidden Block:</h2>
    <p>You’ve been trained to believe that selflessness = goodness. But overgiving is a form of self-abandonment. It’s time to come back home to yourself—<em>to receive with the same heart you give from</em>.</p>

    <h2>🌿 Your Shift:</h2>
    <p>You don’t need another strategy that tells you to give more. You need a sales flow that honors your energy—one where you're supported and no longer leaking your power in the name of being “nice.”</p>

    <h2>🔑 Your Next Step:</h2>
    <p>Let’s get clear on your offer, pricing, and boundaries—so you can serve powerfully without self-sacrifice.</p>
