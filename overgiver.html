    <h1>Your Sales Archetype: The Overgiver</h1>
    <p>You have a beautiful heart. You care deeply about others, and you likely entered your work because you wanted to make a difference. But somewhere along the way, you started giving more than you were receiving.</p>

    <p>You may find yourself:
      <ul>
        <li>Overdelivering in your offers out of guilt</li>
        <li>Undercharging or avoiding pricing altogether</li>
        <li>Letting boundaries blur in client relationships</li>
        <li>Feeling emotionally exhausted from holding so much space</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>The Truth Is...</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to give yourself away to serve powerfully. In fact, when your energy is clean and your offer is structured, your clients get better results—and you feel better too.</p>

    <h2>Next Step: Begin Your Realignment</h2>
    <p>I created a space just for women like you—heart-led entrepreneurs who are ready to sell high-ticket services without the burnout, guilt, or games. This is where your sacred structure begins.</p>
