    <h1>Your Archetype: The Overgiver</h1>
    <p class="subheading">You lead with your heart—but often at your own expense.</p>

    <p>You care. Deeply. You pour yourself into your work and your clients. You want to serve, to heal, to be the one who holds space and delivers value.</p>

    <p>But somewhere along the way, your boundaries got blurred. You've undercharged, over-delivered, or hesitated to even *make* the offer—because you didn’t want to come off as “too much.”</p>

    <p>It’s not because you’re weak. It’s because you were taught that your worth is measured by how much you give—not how much you receive.</p>

    <p><strong>You’re here to rewrite that.</strong></p>

    <p>When you align your sales energy, you stop trying to prove your value—and start standing in it. Selling becomes service. Boundaries become sacred. And income becomes natural.</p>

    <p><strong>From Monique:</strong><br>
    I see your heart. And I also see your exhaustion. You don’t need to keep proving your magic—you just need the structure to protect it. That’s where I come in.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px;">
